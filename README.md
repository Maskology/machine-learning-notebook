## Use Chrome Extension

If you use chrome based browser (Google Chrome, Brave etc.)

You can use [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo) to open notebook

Because the `Open in Colab` in .ipynb file is using static url to notebook in **main** branch 

So if you want to open notebook from other than main branch (e.g for code review in PR) you better use this extension
